# 🧠 Fetal Health Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project builds an intelligent system for classifying fetal health status using cardiotocographic (CTG) data. It predicts whether a fetus is in a **Normal**, **Suspect**, or **Pathological** state. The goal is to aid clinicians in making early and accurate decisions through data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visual insights  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing** including feature scaling and handling class imbalance  
- 🤖 **Model Building**: Tested multiple ML classifiers — Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.  
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
- 🌐 **Deployment**: Real-time prediction app using Streamlit

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset used is based on CTG recordings, containing attributes such as:  
- Baseline fetal heart rate  
- Accelerations and decelerations  
- Uterine contractions  
- Short- and long-term variability
