#🧠 Fetal Health Classification using Machine Learning

#📌 Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to classify the health status of a fetus based on cardiotocographic (CTG) features. The model predicts whether a fetus is in a Normal, Suspect, or Pathological state. The goal is to support clinicians with early and accurate fetal health assessment through data-driven insights.

🚀 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling, Handling class imbalance
- Model Selection: Evaluation of multiple ML classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM)
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Deployment: Interactive web app using Streamlit
